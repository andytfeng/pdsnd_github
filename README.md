### Project Title
Github Project: Git Commands

### Description
Use Git to control the version of both my local and remote repositories. The Git Commands project simulates the workflow used in industry by using the Python code I completed for a previous project called Bikeshare project. For the Git Commands project, there are four parts: 1) set up my repository on both my local machine and then up on GitHub, 2) improve the documentation on a documentation branch, 3) refactor my code on a refactoring branch, and 4) merge all of my branches together and add changes to the remote repository.
